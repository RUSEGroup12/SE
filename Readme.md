- [ ] Get a general idea of how each project should get started
- [ ] Start working on Report 1 Part 1

## HOMEWORK Before meeting on 2/3
- Know git command line or software
- Be prepared with the 3 questions:
  1. What **did** I do in this past week that helped the team with the goal?
  2. What **will** I do this week to help the team reach the goal?
  3. Do I see any impediments that prevent me or the development team from meeting it's goal?

## Questions?
1. Should we use google docs for the documentation?
  - Akhil : I think we should do it in google docs and also keep a website type thing for the project. I can do that using markdown, and just host it on my site which will make it easier to organize things.
  - Bhargav: Documentation on google doc. Code and link to documentation on this git repo. Emphasis keep a link in the git repo

2. Q2 How do you guys feel about the parking garage question?
  - Akhil : I like the traffic one because we have freedom to expand on it how we wish. The parking garage one may be easier, but how are we going to significantly improve on it to get the A?
  - Bhargav: I think the parking deck idea is great and actually board. Here is an idea. We have cameras/ sensors that detect when a car is entering and a software system that will contact your phone and tell you where to park based on what place your trying to get to. For example a mall parking deck would have you park on 1st floor for x stores and 2nd floor for y stores. this can also monitor the occupancy and crowdedness of the stores/mall/parking deck in general

3. Q3 Should we subdivide into smaller groups like Marsic recommended?

  - Akhil: We have to divide and we have to give him the subgroups(not the members in each atm), but we have to give him the topics that the subgroups will be working on.
