## Questions?
1. Should we use google docs for the documentation?
  - Akhil : I think we should do it in google docs and also keep a website type thing for the project. I can do that using markdown, and just host it on my site which will make it easier to organize things.

2. Q2 How do you guys feel about the parking garage question?
  - Akhil : I like the traffic one because we have freedom to expand on it how we wish. The parking garage one may be easier, but how are we going to significantly improve on it to get the A?
